Topics: \begin{itemize}
\item Lecture 05 (Training Versus Testing)
\item Lecture 06 (Theory of Generalization)
\end{itemize}
\hrule \ \\
For Exercises 1 to 3, the approach is to `plug and chug' with the Hoeffding Inequality. First, solve the inequality for $N$:
	\begin{align*}
	0.03 &\geq 2Me^{-2\epsilon^2N}\\\ \\
	\dfrac{0.03}{2M} &\geq e^{-2\epsilon^2N}\\\ \\
	\text{log} \dfrac{0.03}{2M} &\geq -2\epsilon^2N\\\ \\
	\dfrac{\text{log}\dfrac{0.03}{2M}}{-2\epsilon^2} &\leq N
	\end{align*}
Then make the substitutions as below.
\begin{enumerate}
\item B: 1000\\
	Let  $\epsilon=0.05, M = 1$
	\begin{align*}
	\dfrac{\text{log}\dfrac{0.03}{2(1)}}{-2 (0.05)^2} &\leq N\\\ \\
	N &\geq 840
	\end{align*}
\item C: 1500\\
	Let  $\epsilon=0.05, M = 10$
	\begin{align*}
	\dfrac{\text{log}\dfrac{0.03}{2(10)}}{-2 (0.05)^2} &\leq N\\\ \\
	N &\geq 1300
	\end{align*}
\item D: 2000\\
	Let  $\epsilon=0.05, M = 100$
	\begin{align*}
	\dfrac{\text{log}\dfrac{0.03}{2(100)}}{-2 (0.05)^2} &\leq N\\\ \\
	N &\geq 1761
	\end{align*}
\item B: 5 \\
Mentally model the problem using examples from lecture 5 as a guide. A heuristic is evident: surround a $+1$ point with a group of $-1$ points (or vice versa). For $\R^3$, place a point within a pyramid of triangular base. (Figure \ref{breakpointR3})
	\begin{figure}[ht!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=50mm]{hw03q04model.eps}
	\caption{Example layout for $k=5$ break point for Perceptron Model in $\R^3$}
	\label{breakpointR3}
	\end{figure}
	
\newpage
\item B: i, ii, v\\
Formulae i and v were seen in lecture as valid growth functions. Formula ii is similar to i, with only a combinatorial addition which is acceptable.

Formulae iii and iv make use of the floor function, $\lfloor \cdot \rfloor$. Recall that $\text{floor}(x) = \lfloor x \rfloor$ is the largest integer not greater than $x$. For both iii and iv, for low values of $N$, the results are equal to 1, which is too low to allow a dichotomy on 1 or more points.

\item C: 5\\
Solve by drawing several points and looking for a configuration that can't be properly enclosed by either interval. See Figure \ref{breakpoint2intervals}.
	\begin{figure}[ht!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=50mm]{hw03q06.pdf}
	\caption{Example layout for $k=5$ break point for ``2-intervals" learning model. Due to the arrangement of the 5 points, the point on the far right cannot be enclosed within an interval, thus breaking the hypothesis set.}
	\label{breakpoint2intervals}
	\end{figure}

\item C: \(\left( 
\begin{array}{c} N+1\\ 4 \end{array}\right) + \left( \begin{array}{c} N+1\\ 2 \end{array}\right) + 1\)

Review from lecture 5 how one interval was treated: \[\left( \begin{array}{c}N+1\\2 \end{array}\right)\]
This is a combinatoric, stating ``from $N+1$ choose 2 items". The above combinatoric was then substituted into $N+1$:
\[ \left( \begin{array}{c} N+1\\ 2 \end{array}\right) + 1\]

For a ``2-intervals" learning model, there are thus 4 sections from which to choose out of $N+1$ total sections of a line containing $N$ points. One might suppose that the solution to this exercise to be  \(\left( \begin{array}{c}N+1\\4 \end{array}\right)+1\), but this does not account for the combinations that occur when the pair of intervals overlap, effectively acting like a single interval. Thus, we must add the disjoint combinations to arrive at 
\[\left( 
\begin{array}{c} N+1\\ 4 \end{array}\right) + \left( \begin{array}{c} N+1\\ 2 \end{array}\right) + 1\]

\item D: $2M+1$\\
Establish a pattern based on what we have seen so far: 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item ``1-interval" learning model with breakpoint $k=3$.
	\item ``2-interval" learning model with breakpoint $k=5$.
	\item \dots (determine the breakpoints for several more intervals)
	\item ``$M$-interval" learning model with breakpoint $k=2M+1$.
	\end{itemize}

\item D: 7\\
To approach this problem, start by drawing points, e.g. 7 points, on a circle. Next, paint the points in alternating colors. There will happen to be two adjacent points that will be the same color. Draw a triangle dissecting the circle, enclosing all points of the same color. Repeat this procedure with 8 points to see that it is not possible to shatter the points. Thus, we have determined the breakpoint $k=8$ and the maximum points that can be shattered is $N=7$. As seen in lecture, arranging points along a circle is useful for convex shapes.
See Figure \ref{trianglemaxshatter}. If $N\geq8$, it is not possible to shatter the points for this learning model.

	\caption{$N=7$ (depicted as points on a heptagon) is the maximum number of points that can be shattered by the ``triangle" learning model.}
	\label{trianglemaxshatter}
	\end{figure}
	
\newpage
\item B. \(\left( \begin{array}{c}N+1\\2\end{array}\right)+1\)\\
Given the symmetry of the concentric circles, we can simply extend a line from the center outward. Along the radial line are placed points of alternating color. As depicted in Figure \ref{conccircle}, the ``concentric circle" learning model is similar to the ``1-interval" linear model we saw in lecture 5. The growth functions are identical: \[m_\mathcal{H}(N)=\left( \begin{array}{c}N+1\\2 \end{array}\right)+1\]
